Functional Programming for the Object-Oriented Programmer
=========

# TODO

* Leiningen - what is it, how it will help me? 

* **DONE** Unit testing framework

Using provided `clojure.test` framework

* **DONE** Install Clojure 

Using `homebrew` for that: 

    brew install clojure
    
To run REPL, use `clj`. To run a file, use `clj <filename>`

* **DONE** Try REPL from command line
* **DONE** Text editor - IntelliJ IDEA, Emacs?

Using Emacs with basic `clojure-mode` for now.
