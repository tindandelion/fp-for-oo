Functional Programming for the Object-Oriented Programmer
=========

# TODO

* Chapter 2
* Running tests automatically and continuously
* Leiningen - what is it, how it will help me? 

# DONE

* Rainbow mode for Emacs
* Chapter 1
  DONE Review Brian's solutions

* Unit testing framework

Using provided `clojure.test` framework

* Install Clojure 

Using `homebrew` for that: 

    brew install clojure
    
To run REPL, use `clj`. To run a file, use `clj <filename>`

* Try REPL from command line
* Text editor - IntelliJ IDEA, Emacs?

Using Emacs with basic `clojure-mode` for now.
